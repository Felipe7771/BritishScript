# *BritishScript :gb: (GB)*
*or the Great Britain code...* is A **Comic** programming language about the British Empire, made in python

## Please bear in mind **not to take the language seriously**, as it is deliberately developed to be comical by recounting events and figures that were used during the *great British Empire*, replacing known commands with such sayings.

### Our dilemmas are:
> Mastering programming is also part of the Empire;

> 25% of the world was too little for us;

> I hope Java also has room for tea;

> If it compiles, it conquers.

> Every exception shall be RAJ-ed.

> Tea is not optional. Itâ€™s required().
