### ðŸ§¾ `Types of variables`

#### 1. **'slave'**
> No empire can sustain itself on its own; labor is always needed to operate materials, store resources, trade, etc. From this, the nomenclature of the person responsible for storing such resources was defined, **'slave'**, and this is the method for simple data storage:
> Texts;
> Numbers:
> Boolean;

>However, the empire also needs to order these slaves so that they store what we want correctly, using the **'do'** method, similar to '='.

##### Structure of the method:
> **slave** var_name **do** value

##### Examples:
> **slave** name **do** "Elisabeth"
> **slave** age **do** 98
> **slave** alive **do** false
