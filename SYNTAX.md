### ðŸ§¾ _`For power, hands need to do this`_

## 1. **`'slave'`**
 No empire can sustain itself on its own; labor is always needed to operate materials, store resources, trade, etc. From this, the nomenclature of the person responsible for storing such resources was defined, **'slave'**, and this is the method for simple data storage:
 Texts;
 Numbers:
 Boolean.

 However, the empire also needs to order these slaves so that they store what we want correctly, using the **'do'** method, similar to '='.

##### Structure of the method:
> **slave** var_name **do** value

##### Examples:
> **slave** name **do** "Elisabeth"

> **slave** age **do** 98

> **slave** alive **do** false

##### Summary:
| GB Keyword | Equivalent in Traditional Languages | Description |
|------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| `slave`    | `let` / `var` / `const`             | Declares a variable |
| `do`       | `=`                                 | Assign a value |

			
## 2. **`'tea'`**
 A top-level empire cannot lack one essential thing. Wealth? Power? Decimating tribes? None of that... **TEA! lots of tea!** But how do we get lots of tea? Simple, as we already have slaves inserted, we'll make them work to produce each one, being a mass production! 

 Just as we know _lists_, we know it as **'tea'**.

##### Structure of the method:
> **slave** var_name **do** **tea** **{** value1 , value2, value3, ... **}** 

##### Examples:
> **slave** slave_tea **do** **tea** **{** tea , tea, tea **}**

> **slave** ages **do** **tea** **{** 15, 34, 10, 56, 78 **}**

> **slave** colonies **do** **tea** **{** Africa, India, China, Australia, North America **}**

##### Summary:
| GB Keyword | Equivalent in Traditional Languages | Description |
|------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| `tea`      | `[]`                                | List declaration |
| `{}`       | `[]`                                | List range |
| `,`        | `,`                                 | Data separator |


## 3. **`'sugar'`**
 There's nothing better than spending an afternoon sipping tea while the slaves work for you, but what would you need to put in the tea to make the most of it? Sugar! But in 
 order to do that, we have to make sure that each tea has a certain amount of sugar in it, another job for our slaves...

 Just as we know the dicionaries, let's look at them from the context of **'sugar'**

##### Structure of the method:
> **slave** var_name **do** **sugar** **{** key1 **=>** value1 , key2 **=>** value2 , ... **}** 

##### Examples:
> **slave** slave_tea **do** **sugar** **{** "King" **=>** 12 , Queen **=>** 15 **}** 

> **slave** empire **do** **sugar** **{** "Army" **=>** tea **{** "Soldiers", "Navy", "Airplanes"**}** , Money **=>** "1.5T"**}**

| `sugar`      | `[]`                                | Dicionary declaration |
| `{}`       | `[]`                                | Dicionary range |
| `=>`        | `:`                                 | Key value |
| `,`        | `,`                                 | Keys separator |
