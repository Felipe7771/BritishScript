### ðŸ§¾ `Types of variables`

#### 1. **'slave'**
 No empire can sustain itself on its own; labor is always needed to operate materials, store resources, trade, etc. From this, the nomenclature of the person responsible for storing such resources was defined, **'slave'**, and this is the method for simple data storage:
 Texts;
 Numbers:
 Boolean.

 However, the empire also needs to order these slaves so that they store what we want correctly, using the **'do'** method, similar to '='.

##### Structure of the method:
> **slave** var_name **do** value

##### Examples:
> **slave** name **do** "Elisabeth"

> **slave** age **do** 98

> **slave** alive **do** false

##### Summary:
| GB Keyword | Equivalent in Traditional Languages | Description |
|------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| `slave`    | `let` / `var` / `const`             | Declares a variable |
| `do`       | `=`                                 | Assign a value |



#### 2. **'tea'**
 A top-level empire cannot lack one essential thing. Wealth? Power? Decimating tribes? None of that... **TEA! lots of tea!** But how do we get lots of tea? Simple, as we already have slaves inserted, we'll make them work to produce each one, being a mass production! 

 Just as we know _lists_, we know it as **'tea'**.

##### Structure of the method:
> **slave** var_name **do** **tea** **{** value1 , value2, value3, ... **}** 

##### Examples:
> **slave** slave_tea **do** **tea** **{** tea , tea, tea **}**

> **slave** ages **do** **tea** **{** 15, 34, 10, 56, 78 **}**

> **slave** colonies **do** **tea** **{** Africa, India, China, Australia, North America **}**

##### Summary:
| GB Keyword | Equivalent in Traditional Languages | Description |
|------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| `tea`      | `[]`                                | List declaration |
| `{}`       | `[]`                                | List range |
| `,`        | `,`                                 | Data separator |
